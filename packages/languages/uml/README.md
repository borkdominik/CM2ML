## Limitations

Since the complexity of the UML metamodel is high, only the following metamodel elements (and their generalizations) of the `Classes` diagram type will be implemented in their entirety:

- BehavioredClassifier
- Class
- Classifier
- EncapsulatedClassifier
- Extension
- Property
- Operation
- Reception

For a detailed description of the diagram type reference section 11.4 of the UML spec v2.5.1.
